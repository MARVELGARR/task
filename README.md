Dependencies used : chartjs2, react-charts-2, uuid, react-date-picker, radix-ui, zustan for stat management, react-google chart, tailwind, tailwind merge, zod, react-hook form, class-variance-authority

chartjs2: 

This is a popular charting library for creating interactive and responsive charts in web applications. You can use it to visualize data in various chart types such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, etc. It's widely used for displaying analytics, statistics, and other data-driven insights.

react-charts-2: 

This seems to be a wrapper or extension for Chart.js specifically designed for React applications. It likely provides components or hooks to easily integrate Chart.js with React, making it simpler to create and manage charts within React components.

uuid: 

This package generates universally unique identifiers (UUIDs). UUIDs are useful for generating unique keys for React components, creating unique identifiers for database records, or any situation where you need a guaranteed unique identifier.

react-date-picker: 

This package provides a date picker component for React applications. It allows users to select dates from a calendar interface, making it useful for forms, scheduling applications, and any feature that involves date selection.

radix-ui: 

Radix UI provides a set of low-level React components designed for building accessible and composable user interfaces. It includes components like Button, Popover, Menu, etc., that adhere to best practices for accessibility and customization.

zustan: 

Zustan is likely a typo or an abbreviation. Assuming you meant Zustand, it's a small, fast, and scalable state management library for React. It provides a simple and intuitive API for managing global state in React applications, making it easy to share data between components without the complexity of other state management solutions.

react-google-chart: 

This package integrates Google Charts with React applications, allowing you to create and display Google Charts seamlessly within React components. It's useful for incorporating Google Charts, such as line charts, area charts, and geo charts, into React-based projects.

tailwind: 

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined utility classes for building custom designs without writing custom CSS. It enables rapid prototyping and consistent styling across applications by abstracting common design patterns into reusable classes.

tailwind-merge: 

This package seems to extend Tailwind CSS by providing utilities or helpers for merging Tailwind classes dynamically in React components. It could be useful for dynamically composing class names based on component props or state.

zod: 

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It allows you to define data schemas as TypeScript types and provides runtime validation for those schemas. It's useful for ensuring data integrity, validating user inputs, and enforcing type safety in JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

react-hook-form: 

React Hook Form is a performant and flexible library for managing form state in React applications. It provides a simple API for building forms, handling form validation, and managing form submissions with React hooks.

class-variance-authority: This dependency doesn't seem to be widely known. Without more context, it's difficult to provide a specific use case. It could be a typo or a custom library developed for a specific project.
